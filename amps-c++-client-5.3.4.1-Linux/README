===== AMPS C/C++ Client 5.3.4.1 =====

This directory contains the C and C++ client library for AMPS.

The doc/ directory contains the documentation for the library. Start with
the index.html file in the doc directory.

lib/ contains pre-built, optimized static libraries for Linux and Windows.
   See the developers' guide for details on how to customize these.

samples/ contains sample programs and binaries for them.  Review the source
   code to learn more about how to write AMPS C/C++ programs.

include/ contains header files you'll need to use to write AMPS C/C++ programs.

src/ contains the source code for the AMPS C/C++ library.

GNUmakefile is the root makefile for rebuilding the AMPS library and samples
   on Linux or other UNIX-like systems.

makefile is the root makefile for rebuilding the AMPS library on Windows
   using Microsoft Visual C++ and Microsoft NMAKE.

====== LINUX USERS =====

To build the library or samples on Linux, you must first install
gcc 4.4 or greater on your Linux distribution. Type "make" from
the root of your AMPS C++ client installation to rebuild the AMPS
C++ client static libraries.

====== WINDOWS USERS ======

To build the library or samples on Windows, you must first install
a version of Microsoft Visual Studio with Mainstream Support from
Microsoft (please refer to Microsoft product lifecycle policies).

Once installed, your computer will have one or more new shortcuts to
a "Command Prompt" pre-configured with the appropriate settings for 
running Visual Studio or Windows SDK command-line tools for your
desired platform (x86 or x64). Locate the appropriate "Command Prompt"
shortcut and launch it. The exact name of this shortcut depends on the
specific Visual Studio or Windows SDK version you have installed. For
more information on locating the shortcut, visit:

https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/f35ctcxw.aspx    (for VS users)
https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff660764.aspx    (for SDK users)

Inside this command prompt, navigate to the directory where the AMPS
C++ client is installed, and type "nmake", for example:

    |C:\Users\Pat>cd amps-c++-client-windows                          |
    |                                                                 |
    |C:\Users\Pat\amps-c++-client-windows>nmake                       |
    |                                                                 |

    |...                                                              |
    +-----------------------------------------------------------------+

If typing "nmake" results in an error that "'nmake' is not recognized as
an internal or external command...", this means your Command Prompt is
not properly configured to use the Visual Studio or Windows SDK. Visit
the links above for more information on finding and starting a properly
configured command prompt.
