8. Delta Publish and Subscribe
=============================================

Introduction
-------------

Delta messaging in AMPS has two independent aspects:

-  delta subscribe allows subscribers to receive just the fields that
   are updated within a message.

-  delta publish allows publishers to update and add fields within a
   message by publishing only the updates into the SOW.

This chapter describes how to create delta publish and delta subscribe
commands using the AMPS C++ client. For a discussion of this capability,
how it works, and how message types support this capability see the
*AMPS User Guide*.

Delta Subscribe
---------------

To delta subscribe, you simply use the ``delta_subscribe`` command as
follows:

.. code-block:: cpp

    // assumes that client is connected and logged on

    Command cmd("delta_subscribe");
    cmd.setTopic("delta_topic");
    cmd.setFilter("/thingIWant = 'true'");

    for (auto m : client.execute(cmd))
    {
        // Delta messages arrive here
    }

As described in the *AMPS User Guide*, messages provided to a delta
subscription will contain the fields used to generate the SOW key and
any changed fields in the message. Your application is responsible for
choosing how to handle the changed fields.

Delta Publish
-------------

To delta publish, you use the ``delta_publish`` command as follows:

.. code-block:: cpp

    /* assumes that client is connected and logged on */

    String msg = ... ; // obtain changed fields here

    client.deltaPublish("myTopic", msg);

The message that you provide to AMPS must include the fields that the
topic uses to generate the SOW key. Otherwise, AMPS will not be able to
identify the message to update. For SOW topics that use a User-Generated
SOW Key, use the ``Command`` form of ``delta_publish`` to set the
``SowKey``.

.. code-block:: cpp

    /* assumes that client is connected and logged on */
         
    String msg = ... ; // obtain changed fields here
    String key = ... ; // obtain user-generated SOW key

    Command cmd("delta_publish");
    cmd.setTopic("delta_topic");
    cmd.setSowKey(key);
    cmd.setData(msg);

    /* Execute the delta publish. Use an empty
     * a message handler since any failure acks will
     * be routed to the FailedWriteHandler
     */
    client.executeAsync(cmd,MessageHandler());
