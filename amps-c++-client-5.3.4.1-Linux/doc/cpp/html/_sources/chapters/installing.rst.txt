2. Installing the AMPS Client
=============================

Obtaining the Client
--------------------

Before using the client, you will need to download and install it on
your development computer. The client is packaged into a single file,
``amps-c++-client-<version>.tar.gz``, where <version> is replaced by the
version of the client, such as ``amps-c++-client-3.3.0.zip``. In the
following examples, the version number is omitted from the filename.

Once expanded, the ``amps-c++-client`` directory will be created,
containing sources, samples and makefiles for the C++ client. You’re
welcome to locate this directory anywhere that seems convenient; but for
the remainder of this book, we’ll simply refer to this directory as the
``amps-c++-client`` directory.

Explore the client
------------------

The client is organized into a number of directories that you’ll be
using through this book. Understanding this organization now will save
you time in the future. The top level directories are:

lib
^^^

The directory that contains built libraries. The distribution contains a
set of pre-built libraries from 60East. You can use the prebuilt library
or rebuild the library using the provided makefiles. Many applications
rebuild the library using the exact compiler version and flags that they
will use for the overall project.

src
^^^

Sources and makefile for the AMPS C++ client library.

include
^^^^^^^

Location of ``include`` files for C and C++ programs. When building your
own program, you’ll add the ``include`` directory to your ``include``
path.

samples
^^^^^^^

Getting started with a new C/C++ library can be challenging. For your
reference, we provide a number of small samples, along with a makefile.

Build the Client
----------------

After unpacking the ``amps-c++-client`` directory, you must build the
client library for your platform. To do so, change to the
``amps-c++-client`` directory and, from a command prompt, type:

.. code:: cpp

    make

to make a static library, or

.. code:: cpp

   SHARED=1 make

to make a shared object.

On Windows, from a Visual Studio Command Prompt, type:

.. code:: cpp

    msbuild 

Upon successful completion, the AMPS libraries and  samples
are built in the ``lib`` and ``samples`` directories,
respectively.

.. include:: ./test-connectivity-to-amps.inc
