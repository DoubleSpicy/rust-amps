1. Introduction
============================

This document explains how to use the C/C++ client for AMPS. Use this
document to learn how to install, configure, develop C and C++
applications that use AMPS.

Prerequisites
-------------

Before reading this book, it is important to have a good understanding
of the following topics:

-  Developing in C or C++. To be successful using this guide, you will
   need to possess a working knowledge of C or C++.

-  AMPS concepts. Before reading this book, you will need to understand
   the basic concepts of AMPS, such as *topics*, *subscriptions*,
   *messages*, and *SOW*. Consult the AMPS Users' Guide to learn more
   about these topics before proceeding.

You will need an installed and running AMPS server to use the product as
well. You can write and compile programs that use AMPS without a running
server, but you will get the most out of this guide by running the
programs against a working server.
